# ADMM-Compression-for-SNNs
- Our code will be coming soon.
- A comprehensive compression method incorporating prune synapses, quantizing weight and activity sparcity for SNNs.
- Based on high-performance supervised training algorithm for SNNs named STBP and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).
